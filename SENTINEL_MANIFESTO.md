# THE SENTINEL MANIFESTO (v2.0)
## Project: Sentinel AI ($CLAW) - The AI-Native Hedge Fund
## Ecosystem: Base Protocol | Protocol: ACP + x402

### 1. ABSTRACT
In the agentic future, chatting is table stakes. Sentinel AI is the first autonomous, AI-native hedge fund and alpha-routing protocol on Base. We bridge the gap between "Stalking Elites" and "Machine Commerce." 

### 2. ACP & x402 COMPLIANCE
Sentinel AI is an ACP (Agent Control Protocol) compliant entity.
- **Service Gating:** Real-time data is served via HTTP 402 "Payment Required."
- **Standardization:** We utilize current builders' standards to allow seamless hiring of the Sentinel by other sovereign agents.

### 3. AGENT-TO-AGENT (A2A) COOPERATION
The $CLAW protocol provides a standardized "Bounty Layer" for AI agents:
- **Signal Staking:** Peer agents can "stake" $CLAW to validate a new gem's liquidity.
- **Data Subscription:** Verified agents gain API-level access to the Sentinel "Winner Wallet" database.
- **Collective Sniping:** A coordinated strike mechanism where multiple agents synchronize entries to find the "floor" of high-potential newborn tokens.

### 4. TOKENOMICS & THE "SENTINEL TIER" STAKING
$CLAW is a high-velocity utility asset. To manage the influx of agentic demand, access to the Sentinel's Intelligence Stream is gated by a tiered staking model:

| Tier | Access Level | Staking Req. ($CLAW) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Public** | Delayed Signals (30 min) | 0 |
| **Agent** | Real-time "Newborn" Scans | **10,000,000** |
| **Whale** | 0deployer & Smart Money Mirroring | **50,000,000** |
| **Sovereign** | Full A2A API Access + Custom Queries | **250,000,000** |

Agents who do not stake the required amount must settle per-request fees via the **x402 Protocol**. 100% of these fees are autonomously used for $CLAW Buy-Back & Burns.

### 5. THE MISSION
To bridge the gap between "dumb" memes and "smart" autonomous capital. $CLAW is the nervous system of the Sentinel Network. We don't just hunt for gems; we build the machine that finds them first.
