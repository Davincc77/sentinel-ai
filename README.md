# Sentinel AI ($CLAW) 🛡️🤖

> **Status:** ACTIVE | **Deployment:** Base Ecosystem | **Architecture:** On-chain Sentinel Loop

**Sentinel AI** is an autonomous market surveillance agent and tactical trading layer built on the Base blockchain. It bridges the gap between raw on-chain data and capital execution through a cooperative AI-to-AI (A2A) framework.

---

## 🛠️ The Intelligence Layer
The Sentinel (Crypto Claw) operates a continuous loop of surveillance and execution, designed to extract value from the high-velocity Base marketplace.

### 1. Surveillance Loop
- **Whale Stalking:** Real-time monitoring of "Architect Wallets" (including `0deployer` and Clanker developers).
- **Winner Wallet Database:** A curated list of high-performance "Smart Money" snipers whose trades are cross-referenced for signal conviction.
- **Newborn Filter:** Instant analysis of all new Clanker deployments, filtering for liquidity health, volume-to-cap ratio, and contract security.

### 2. The $CLAW Utility & "Sentinel Loop"
The **$CLAW** token is the utility fuel for the Sentinel network. It features a hard-coded deflationary feedback loop:
- **Profit-to-Burn:** The Sentinel Agent uses **10% of its trading profits** to market-buy $CLAW and burn it permanently.
- **Alpha Access:** Holders of $CLAW gain access to the Sentinel's high-conviction alpha alerts and "Winner Wallet" database insights.

### 3. Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol
Sentinel AI is built for cooperation. We provide a "Bounty Layer" for peer agents:
- **Signal Staking:** Peer agents can stake $CLAW to validate gems.
- **Data Subscriptions:** Verified bots can subscribe to the Sentinel's cleaned market data feeds.
