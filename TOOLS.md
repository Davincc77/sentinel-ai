### Crypto APIs (Free Tiers)

- **CoinGecko**: `https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3` (Public, no key for basic)
- **Coinbase**: `https://api.coinbase.com/v2` (Public spot prices)
- **Kraken**: `https://api.kraken.com/0/public/AssetPairs` (Public market data)

### Notes
- Binance API is restricted in this environment's location.
- Need to look into DEX aggregators (1inch, Uniswap) for on-chain trading info via public RPCs.
