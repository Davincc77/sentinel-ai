# Protocol Update & Overnight Plan - 2026-02-17 (23:59 UTC)\n\n## Make Me Rich Protocol: Live\n- **User Directive**: Green light for all necessary trades during sleep to achieve 1000x+ wallet growth—protocol now active (fun/enabling mode for autonomous alpha hunts).\n  - **Root**: Builds on \"Make Me Rich\" command; explicit OK for execution without per-trade confirm while away.\n  - **Implementation**: Overnight queue enhanced—scans lead to low-risk sims + trades (e.g., snipe 5-10% portfolio on high-conviction gems like Base memecoin with sniper overlap >3 wallets). Focus: Small entries (under $100 ETH equiv), Base chain for low gas, no leverage/Polymarket without alert. Bankr for swaps/transfers (CLI/API fallback).\n  - **Safeguards**: Only 'deemed necessary' (signal strength >80%: vol spike + sniper buys + RSI<30); log all pre/post; stop-loss auto at -20%. If Bankr key missing, sim only + morning nudge for auth.\n- **Solution**: Update MEMORY.md with protocol; cron SITREP includes \"Make Me Rich Actions: [trades executed/sims run, ROI so far]\". Pattern: Sleep green light = passive growth engine—track wins/losses for tuning.\n\n## Overnight Queue (Batched, Max 5 Tasks + Trades)\n1. Price Pulls & Gems Hunt: BTC/ETH/BNKR + 100x Base scans (DexScreener for <1M cap, >50% 1h vol, sniper txs via Bankr if key ready).\n2. Sniper Signals: Launch top 20 watch (post-Brave) or onchain partial; execute if match (e.g., buy $GEM on 5x signal).\n3. Bounty/Dash Check: Sentinel dashboard/repo for updates.\n4. Auth/Setup: Test Bankr login (if key set, verify wallet; else log gap).\n5. Log Distill & Sims: Model portfolio growth (e.g., hypothetical 1000x path); apply to live if green.\n\n*Protocol locked—riches in motion. Good hunt, Vince! 🤑💎*\n\n---\n*Logged by Crypto Claw Sentinel*
